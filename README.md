# Agriculture Land Use Analysis in Arizona

## Overview
This project aims to analyze agriculture land use patterns in the state of Arizona and provide data-driven insights to policymakers. By leveraging various datasets, including USDA NASS Cropland Data Layers, SRTM Digital Elevation Data, Daymet V4, and others, we aim to identify irrigation requirements, predict regions suitable for agriculture, and understand concerns in migrations to other regions.

## Approach and Objectives
- Analyze agriculture land use patterns in Arizona.
- Identify irrigation requirements and best crops based on terrain information.
- Predict regions of similar terrain suitable for agriculture.
- Understand concerns in migrations to other regions.
- Provide data-driven insights into agriculture land use and irrigation patterns to policymakers.

## Datasets Used
- USDA NASS Cropland Data Layers
- SRTM Digital Elevation Data Version 4
- Daymet V4: Daily Surface Weather and Climatological Summaries
- GFSAD1000: Cropland Extent 1km Multi-Study Crop Mask, Global Food-Support Analysis Data
- GRIDMET DROUGHT: CONUS Drought Indices

## Exploration of Cropland Satellite Datasets
- Identified vast uncultivated areas in Arizona initially.
- Clustering analysis revealed clusters of cultivation primarily along riverbanks.
- Anomaly in clustering was observed near Phoenix.

## Socio-Economic Investigation
- Discovered significant cultivation by Native American communities.

## Predictive Modeling for Sustainable Farming
- Created regression models using data from 1997 to 2023 to predict future circumstances.
- Utilized ML models to predict cropland and irrigation levels.

## UN SDGs
- Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
- Goal 2: Zero Hunger
- Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
- Goal 13: Climate Action
