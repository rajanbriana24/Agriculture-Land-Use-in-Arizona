# Agriculture Land Use Analysis in Arizona

Welcome to our Agriculture Land Use Analysis project focused on the state of Arizona! This project delves into the intricate patterns of agricultural land use, aiming to provide comprehensive insights into cultivation practices, irrigation requirements, and socio-economic implications. Our approach combines advanced data analysis techniques with predictive modeling to offer valuable information for policymakers, researchers, and agricultural stakeholders.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- Analyze agriculture land use patterns in Arizona.
- Identify irrigation requirements and best crops based on terrain information.
- Predict regions of similar terrain suitable for agriculture.
- Understand concerns in migrations to other regions.
- Provide data-driven insights into agriculture land use and irrigation patterns to policymakers.

## Datasets Used
We utilize a diverse range of datasets to achieve our objectives, including:
- USDA NASS Cropland Data Layers
- SRTM Digital Elevation Data Version 4
- Daymet V4: Daily Surface Weather and Climatological Summaries
- GFSAD1000: Cropland Extent 1km Multi-Study Crop Mask, Global Food-Support Analysis Data
- GRIDMET DROUGHT: CONUS Drought Indices

## Approach
Our approach involves a series of comprehensive analyses and modeling techniques:
- **Exploration of Cropland Satellite Datasets**: Initial analysis revealed vast uncultivated areas, prompting further investigation.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Identification of cultivation clusters along riverbanks and anomalies near urban centers like Phoenix using DBSCAN clustering.
- **Linear Regression Modeling**: Usage of linear regression models to predict precipitation, temperature (Tmax), and drought conditions.
- **Socio-Economic Investigation**: Discovery of significant cultivation by Native American communities.
- **Predictive Modeling for Sustainable Farming**: Creation of regression models and machine learning algorithms to predict future circumstances and suggest sustainable farming practices.

## UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
Our project aligns with several UN SDGs, including:
- Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
- Goal 2: Zero Hunger
- Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
- Goal 13: Climate Action
